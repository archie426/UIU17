# Item Updater for Unturned 2017

Put everything beginning with ItemUpdater (except the .sln file and the .csproj file) into your items folder. If you get some sort of error or CMD closes immediately it means you've missed something out, 
OR
* You haven't installed .NET SDK 2.1 (Required)
* dotnet hasn't been set as an Environment Variable (should be automatically done in the installation)

Some files may need rebundling, which this doesn't do. Tested with UNTURNED RP Bundle (A somewhat 950 files that needed changing, so you can see the need) and it works.
