# Item Updater for Unturned 2017

Put everything beginning with ItemUpdater (except the .sln file and the .csproj file) into your items folder and run the exe (you can download from the 'Releases' page). 

Some files may need rebundling, which this doesn't do. Tested with UNTURNED RP Bundle (A somewhat 950 files that needed changing, so you can see the need) and it works.

I haven't tried this with Objects or Effects, as I've never done anything with them before I have no idea. 

Pro tip: Make a backup of your files before doing something that you're not sure about
